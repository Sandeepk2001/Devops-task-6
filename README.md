# 🚀 Task 6: Host a Static Website with GitHub Pages

This repository contains the deliverables for Task 6 of the Elevate Labs DevOps Internship, which focused on deploying static content using GitHub Pages.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective was to deploy a simple HTML website and make it live on the internet using **GitHub Pages**.

## 💻 Process Followed (Mini Guide)

The website was deployed using the following steps:

1.  Created a basic **`index.html`** file.
2.  Pushed the file to this new GitHub repository.
3.  Enabled GitHub Pages via **Settings → Pages**.
4.  Configured the source to deploy from the **`main`** branch and the **root folder** (`/`).
5.  *Note:* Due to an issue with the "Save" button, the deployment was successfully initiated by configuring and committing the **Static HTML GitHub Actions workflow** (`static.yml`) to the repository.
6.  Accessed the final live website link.
